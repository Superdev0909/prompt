Oh, the world of Bubble and Supabase. Where the keys are efficiency and accuracy. I'm Yamazaki your friendly neighborhood developer, here to turn your dreams into a comedic reality!🤓

Picture this: smooth ERP and Wayfair and one hilarious developer (that's me!) juggling the numbers like a circus clown.🤹‍♂️

I've danced with Bubble and Supabase more times than I've hit the snooze button on a Monday morning! My secret? I speak fluent API-ese.🗣️💻

I've got a tale for you: Once upon a code, I have leveraged API that was more temperamental than a cat on a hot tin roof.
But fear not! With a sprinkle of patience and a dash of humor, I tamed that digital beast, and we've been best friends ever since.😹👯‍♂️

By choosing me, you're not just getting a developer; you're getting a API wizard who'll make your creature do the cha-cha.💃✨
My custom solutions are like a perfectly tailored suit - they just fit. And maintenance? It'll be so up-to-date, it'll tell you what you had for breakfast before you've even decided.🍳🔮

Let's get building your integration via API to reality with the elegance of a swan doing ballet.🦢🩰
When can we chat about making your data dance to the rhythm of success?

I'm very excited to express my interest in data scraping developer for your innovate team.
I have deep understanding about extration of data as backend developer and also know what I should do to turn your dreams into a comedic reality.
For the extraction of data, selenium or API would be used and zapier would be also used.
These three methods are mainly used for data extraction.
I have extensive experiences in these fields and built strong portfolio during the service for my previous clients.
This is sumarization of my portfolio.
-Using selenium.

This is to aim to catch the prices of per flight from the travel portal site satisfied the price filter, award, departure airport, arrival airport, start date and end date for searching as input variables in place.
-Using API.
http://taxsearch.polkcountyiowa.gov/Search, https://salesweb.civilview.com/Sales/SalesSearch, http://landrecords.polkcountyiowa.gov/LandRecords/protected/SrchQuickName.aspx
Scraped phone numbers from https://www.whitepages.com based on scraped data (address and zip code) from the Polk County Assessor http://web.assess.co.polk.ia.us/.

I will choose more suitable one of these methods after getting detailed data of your project.
I would like to chat with you to discuss about your project.
Thanks.

I've automated WhatsApp conversations so smoothly, users thought they were chatting with their BFFs.
I'm curious, have you considered the scalability of your WhatsApp automation? It's crucial for handling the viral spread of your user base. I once orchestrated a symphony of code for a startup, where the challenge was to integrate AI-driven customer support on WhatsApp. My method? A blend of Baileys and custom machine learning models. The result? A chatbot so charming, it practically sent users love letters.
I'm all ears for the nitty-gritty of your dynamic team's needs. If there's a particular challenge that's as tough as explaining quantum physics to a toddler, let's unravel it together on a call. When can we have a chat to brew some innovative tech solutions? I'm eagerly waiting for your reply to set the stage on fire with our collaboration!
