Dear Sir. Nice to meet you!
I know what you want and I can help you as an expert.
I am a blockchain architecture expert and also a full stack developer.
My best skill is designing, developing, and maintaining blockchain-based projects. I mastered the entire lifecycle of the blockchain projects from conceptualization and architecture design to implementation, testing, and deployment.

And I have participated in several significant projects like  Yam. Finance, ForwardProtocol, Justbet, Metadallion, etc. I built Tokens, Smart Contracts, and other DApps(decentralized applications) such as oracle, dex,farm, betting sites, etc.
