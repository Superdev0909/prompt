🟢🟢🟢Hello~

Got a moment to chat about your project?  𝐖𝐞 𝐝𝐢𝐝 𝐚 𝐬𝐢𝐦𝐢𝐥𝐚𝐫 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭 𝐛𝐞𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐞. 

As for the experience, here are some of our relevant projects:
1. We implemented scraping from http://taxsearch.polkcountyiowa.gov/Search, https://salesweb.civilview.com/Sales/SalesSearch, http://landrecords.polkcountyiowa.gov/LandRecords/protected/SrchQuickName.aspx
Scraped phone numbers from https://www.whitepages.com based on scraped data (address and zip code) from the Polk County Assessor http://web.assess.co.polk.ia.us/.

2. We delivered a system that collects vacancies description from 3 different websites (Glassdoor, ESL Cafe, Indeed), using provided query templates and keywords for a search. The system is scalable, so more websites to scrape can be easily added with system updates. Challenges were overcoming scraping protection and customizing parser to search based on free-form text. The parser extracts specific fields, including requirements to the candidate, description of the job, and salary.
Scraped data were sent on client`s API to Wordpress website. Integration with existing systems of a client, such as Microsoft Flow, Visual Studio SSIS, MS Azure SQL database and PowerBI, was performed in order to optimize and improve efficiency.

To provide you with a solid implementation plan, I'd love to dive a bit deeper.
Could you share a few more details so we can make sure it's tailored just right:
1. Do you have any preferences in the programming language or would rely on my experience?
2. I wonder whether you have any deadline for your project? It is important to know to select the most efficient approach for implementing your project in time.
3. What data do you need to extract from the API?
4. In what format is the data provided via AP?

Don't worry, we understand that you might not have all the details and answers yet.

If you are interested in a professional solution and you would like to receive a consultation and an evaluation of your project from us, we guarantee you an answer from our side within 10 minutes, immediately after yours.

Thank you for your time for reading this letter.
