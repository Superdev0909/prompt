🟢🟢🟢Hello, 

Got a moment to chat about your project? 𝐖𝐞 𝐝𝐢𝐝 𝐚 𝐬𝐢𝐦𝐢𝐥𝐚𝐫 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭 𝐛𝐞𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐞.

I have read your description and I can definitely help you in developing your website using MERN Stack. I have a good understanding of React.js and its core principles along with experience with popular React.js workflows (such as Flux or Redux). Along with this, I am well versed in the Next.js framework of React.js and developed many projects in it. It enables me to efficiently build fast and SEO-friendly web applications. The server-side rendering ensures quicker page loads and improved search engine visibility.

When it comes to the backend, I am well versed with Node.js frameworks like Express.js, and Nest.js. As for the database I am proficient with MongoDB, and MySQL. On the API front, I have worked extensively on Rest and GraphQL. I have integrated Xero, QuickBooks, ShipEngine, ATS, CRMs, and much more.

In the last 5+ years, I have handled the end-to-end software development life cycle of numerous E-commerce, Marketplaces, Retail, Trading, Pharma, Gaming, and Hospitality businesses. Some of the projects I have developed recently using MERN Stack are ...
