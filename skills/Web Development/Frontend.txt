Digital Media Professional

A top Upwork freelancer with over 12,000 hours billed, a 98% approval rating, and 25 years expertise in growing businesses and all things digital. My goal is to build long-term relationships with clients, not one-time transactions.

What separates me from most freelancers is my small business experience, having owned a retail store for twelve years. This entrepreneurial and marketing background enables me to create websites, digital marketing campaigns, and more, that resonate with your target audience, producing a desired business objective.

I have over 25 years of experience designing and building websites including WordPress, WooCommerce, Divi, Elementor, BigCommerce, Volusion, Shopify, Salesforce, Mailchimp, Shipstation, Gravity Forms, Photoshop, Figma, and XD. Iâ€™m experienced in all front and back end programming languages, enabling extensive versatility.

Skills include e-commerce, SEO, logo design, security, maintenance, landing page design, branding, theme and plugin customization and more.

Iâ€™m super responsive and can adjust my schedule based on your changing needs. Not sure if Iâ€™m the right person for you? I offer a no-risk, free consultation to discuss your project, business strategy and answer any questions you have.
