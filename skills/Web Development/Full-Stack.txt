I have been working in web development since 2006. Starting from designing my own e-commerce store and then I quickly became an open-source developer. I've gained a lot of experience in my 10 years from working with digital agencies in Pennsylvania, California and Texas. I have helped developed hundreds sites using HTML 5, CSS 3, PHP frameworks (such as CodeIgniter and Laravel). I also quickly become a veteran Wordpress developer.

I have a strong background in cloud solutions, especially AWS and Google Cloud. I am familiar with most popular AWS products such as S3, Route 53, SES, SQS, EC2, ECS, ECR, LightSail, Beanstalk, Amplify, etc. For Google Cloud I have experience with Google Firebase, Google VM instances, Bucket, OCR, etc.

Besides website development, I am also a mobile developer. I did the UMass Dining Services app and couple other apps using React Native.

I am a full stack, senior developer with solid knowledge about servers, Linux OS, code development process such as Docker, Vagrant, repository such as Git and SVN. I am always seeking out new technologies and approaches to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of my work. I am excited to bring my skills and experience to a dynamic team where I can make a real impact.
