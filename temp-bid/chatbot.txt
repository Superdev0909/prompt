I hope this message finds you well. My name is Seth Kingry, and I have over 7 years of experience in Chatbot development and Python programming. I have carefully read the requirements for the project and I am confident in my ability to deliver a high-quality solution.

For this project, I will utilize my expertise in Python and software architecture to build a scalable, secure, and reliable backend for your neobank platform. I will integrate with multiple payment providers, design well-structured RESTful APIs, and implement a scalable and reliable database using Postgres. Additionally, I will develop Python-based chatbots for various messaging platforms, ensuring consistent functionality across all channels.
