HiðŸ‘‹,
As an experienced Flutter developer, I am excited to apply my skills and knowledge to contribute to your team and help build innovative mobile applications.
I have extensive experience with Flutter and related technologies including Dart language, state management, Firebase and other third-party libraries. I have built multiple mobile applications using Flutter, including Finance app and Dating app, which are available on both Android and iOS platforms.
My ability to integrate backend into mobile application with RESTful APIs has helped me to build scalable and robust applications.
I am very familiar with Agile methodology and Git for project management, team collaboration and version control. I am confident that my skills and experience make me a strong candidate for your project.
Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing details of your project with you soon.
