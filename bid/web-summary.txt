Full Stack Web Developer/Designer #WordPress #Shopify #Magento

Hello, ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êI am a computer engineer and a full time freelancer as a Full Stack Web Developer.

After I got my first project as a freelancer I realized that this is what I wanted to do. Looking over the projects I have completed and my clients' feedbacks means a lot to me and always keeps me going. As much as I like to create long working relations with my clients, I am always eager to work with new clients. ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

I believe the best thing I gained over my vast experience is the ability to work out of my comfort zone. If I don't know something that doesn't mean I can't do it.

That being said here is a summary of my experience and technical skills in web development:

‚Ä¢ Frameworks: Vuejs, Reactjs, Nextjs, Laravel (PHP)
‚Ä¢ Javascript, TypeScript, Jquery, AJAX
‚Ä¢ HTML 5, CSS 3, .LESS, History API
‚Ä¢ AWS, Serverless AWS, lambda, cognito, CI/CD pipeline
‚Ä¢ Firebase, Cloud functions
‚Ä¢ Wordpress, Wordpress plugins: Woocommerce
Thanksüòâ
