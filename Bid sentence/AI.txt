1. I have gained in delivering company management system using AI.
In previous project, clients can select deliverying method, destination, time and so on.
The system auto generate deliverying schedule based on all the client's requirements.
In addition to that, various kind of AI/ML system, especially time-series data processing was my favorite.

2. For your project I suggest several python libraries for ML system development like Numpy or Scikit-learn.
And for future prediction, I'm going to use ChatGPT to generate basic data.
Also, for appealing and user-interactive interface, I recommend PlotLy or MatPlotLib.
I think Django is the best framework as backend.
If you contact me, I'll share my previous projects which includes many fields like stock market prediction or user engagement.
P.S
I'm familiar with business strategy management system like Hopex.
