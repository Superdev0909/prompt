Nice to meet you.

This is Chris, a full-stack developer with some experience in web3 and blockchain development.

I started my first professional work about 8 years ago and at that time, I'd worked mostly on web frontend ui works using React, Redux, Bootstrap So far, I've also worked on some backend stuffs like building REST apis by Nodejs, Express, and MongoDB as well as other trending web frameworks and libraries.

Since 2018, I have been involved in blockchain development with some amazing crypto projects, encouraged by huge market size and sudden booming. 

My previous works were related to Token-Negotiator, REST API and identifier attestation, where I worked as a full-stack developer, and at that time, I also implemented NFT minting, marketplace, frontend, and migrated the whole project to the new version with integrating web3 and other new building bundle.

So React, solidity and typescript are my basic technical skill set and I enjoy writing codes using javascript and solidity language, and I am confident in several frameworks such as React, Next, Svelte, etc, and I am so interested in crypto projects and 've already got rich experience of crypto as well as dApps development.

I am always eager to learn new things and prefer team works and good communication everyday, at the same time, I will always to try to share new ideas and innovation in front of the whole team.

Personally, I love jogging in the park with my wife or any other family and doing sports stuffs, especially playing football with my friends at the weekend.

I am well aware of the importance 3mint places on my technical skills and experience, I belive 3mint would benefit from hiring me as I am reliable, flexible and am able to adapt even under stressful situations.

Thank you.

I will send you all verifications after this meeting.


First, Your job requirement is really good match with my basic skill sets, especially crypto and payment provider.

As appearance of blockchain, crypto coins have been very familiar with people. I desire front-end or full-stack engineering role that interacts with payment provider.

Bitcoin and ethereum were down more than 50% from their all-time highs in late 2022, but people's interest and demand in crypto remain high. 

Also, Beacon-chain (Ethereum 2.0) will be appeared soon, So It is not sure to predict the future of crypto correctly, however it will never fall down.

I am so interested in crypto projects and 've already got rich experience of crypto as well as dApps development.

As I mentioned on resume, I can offer you my technical skills and experience in various frameworks and platforms.

What we do today can improve all our tomorrows.

I enjoy implementing new logic and eager to learn new things and looking to collaborate on Innovative Projects.

Personally, I love jogging in the park and doing sports stuffs.

Looking forward to talking more about the project and would love to building something incredible together.
