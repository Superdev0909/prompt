from Sunil of AlphaWallet...

I wanted to discuss about your issue and offer support as well.

We support our people, we are fully behind our team mates. There are even instances with very new employee who is only working a minor portion of his time and yet we pay full salary as we want to support our people.  There are more instances where STL is fully supports its people wholeheartedly. 

Let me offer you professional advise, if you are open to feedback. In asynchronous working communication is paramount. Be proactive as well as transparent with your issues early on with your clients/employer/team mates. Atleast 1:1 way to key stakeholders. And this is best done in advance, rather than after the fact. Otherwise they are excuses. Same goes for work, be proactive in communication. 

But other than that, it was good working with you. Thanks for your contributions Jason. Wishing you all the best as well üôÇ üôè
