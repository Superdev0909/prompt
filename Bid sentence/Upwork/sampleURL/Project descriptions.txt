===========Platform for therapists
Platform overview:
The idea of this project is to connect people looking for holistic/alternative therapies and qualified therapists.

Through a personalised diagnosis, the platform provides the client with a suggested list of the main treatments that would meet their needs/pains. In parallel, therapists who are registered for the types of therapies recommended to the client will receive a notification so that they can make contact and offer their services.

What I need is a platform that I think is similar to what Workana delivers, but with an Alternative Therapies audience/niche.

I need to create the client side where they register, request a form, fill it in and receive a list of suggested therapies. This is done through a questionnaire where, depending on the answers, certain therapies are suggested.

And the therapist's side, where he needs to register (through monthly plans), and will receive referrals from clients looking for the skills he needs.
A chat room within the platform for negotiations and closing the appointment.
The platform retains the fee and transfers the % to the therapist once it has been finalised.
