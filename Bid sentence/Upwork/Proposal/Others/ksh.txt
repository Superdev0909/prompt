==========AI
Hello,
Thank you for posting this work.
I have high hopes for this project as I had a similar experience.
Going through the project and the attached documentation gives me a lot of confidence and a feeling of success.
I have developed it in python and node.
I used the LLM Langchain open-eye model for sales marketing support.
And your project is very similar to my previous project.
I used Twilio to send WAPP messages and then implemented media delivery such as PDFs, images, audio, etc.
I used QARefineChain to train the pdf with the OpenAI model.
There were no problems with the project.
I really enjoy working with you and believe in your success.


==================ChatGPT

Hello,
I'm excited about your project with chatgpt.
My rich experience and knowledge with chatgpt integration has made me stronger and more confident.
Do you know my current confidence in your project?
I am a professional OpenAI and langchain developer with chatbot and chatgpt.
My strength shows in my previous chatbot integration projects.
The first was the creation of a chat platform with documents.
This platform allows users to interact with their documents.
And another was for sales marketing on WAPP.
With the langchain model and fine-tuning, I can create a powerful chatgpt integration model as you wish.
As long as you are satisfied with your project, I believe I can do the best for you.
Thank you very much
