Hello.
I checked https://www.eatdeux.com/ and I think the new theme is need.
With your shopify theme, no problem with body page but it is difficult to make nav bar similar with eatdeux.com.
And I think Multi is similar but if you don't care about nav bar(I mean header) then, I can modify with your current theme.
Looking forward to discuss more with you.
Thank you.
