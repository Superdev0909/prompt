Hello, Client I'm familiar with C++ and Microcontroller such as Atmega, Pic, Arduino by using codevision, microc, keil. And then I'm familiar with Object oriented program and Function oriented program. I'd like to work for you. I'll share my program via chat room. Thanks for your kind consideration.

Dear Client,

I hope this message finds you well. As an experienced developer with a strong background in embedded systems, I believe I am well-suited to take on this project. Specifically, I have extensive experience which will be essential components of the system you are looking to build.
I am ready to start programming immediately, because of the development environment is already prepared on my PC.
In terms of my approach to the project, I would begin by carefully assessing your requirements and working closely with you to develop a detailed design plan that meets your needs precisely. From there, I would move into the development phase, building and testing the necessary hardware and software components to ensure that everything is working perfectly.

Throughout the project, I would maintain open lines of communication with you to ensure that we are always on the same page and that you feel confident in the progress being made.

In terms of timeline and budget, I would be happy to work with you to develop a plan that makes sense for your specific needs. I am committed to delivering high-quality work on time and within budget, and I am confident that I can do so for this project.

Thank you for considering me for this opportunity. I am excited about the prospect of working with you and look forward to hearing back from you soon.

Best regards,
