I am looking for an online job for my level of experience and skills. I have been doing with my coding skills nothing for over 4 months and I need a low-paying(because my skills are not good as a professional) job to keep motivated to develop websites. I'm also planning to get back to learn react. I thought upwork would help me and I'm happy to start a new online job.
