We are in the process of building our own CRM system in PHP Laravel adn we'd like to add live chat to our website and other SaaS products we have.
The problem is most of the live chat systems are per-user and demand a minimum user count, costing hundreds of $ per month on a simple live chat.

We're look for a way to build our own live chat so that messages appear in our own crm which we can respond to natively from our CRM, without any external dashboard or login.

The main focus really is on the live chat widget to appear on a the website(s). All chat messages should be pub/sub from our own CRM without any real middleware that requires users to be setup etc.

At this point I think I after just some light ideas from anyone whos done this - e.g. is it even viable? Or is there something OpenSource which can achieve this and we can engage with you to consult / advise if you have prior knowledge on it.

Our existing team is Indian based, so some understand and patience in the language barrier is required.
