Dear Prospective Client,

Thank you for giving me the opportunity to bid on this project. I have extensive experience in web development, and I would be thrilled to build a new article section for your website.

While I understand that you prefer that the website be built without WordPress, I would like to propose that we consider using a different CMS, such as Joomla or Drupal. Both of these platforms offer similar functionality to WordPress, but they may have features that better suit your needs.

In terms of creating the actual article section, I will ensure that the design is consistent with the rest of your website, and that it is easy to navigate. I will also make sure that the section is optimized for search engines, so that your content can be found by as many people as possible.

Thank you for considering my bid, and I look forward to the opportunity to work with you.

Best regards,
