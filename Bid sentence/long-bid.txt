Hi there,
I have spent many years of the complete product lifecycle building blockchain infrastructure for several successful projects such as Bird.Money and Katana Inu, with combined experience in FinTech, software engineering and blockchain architecture.
I have expertise in Solidity, Truffle/Hardhat, Web3.js, Typescript, etc. I am dedicated to writing EVM based Solidity smart contracts for different kinds of DeFi protocols, NFTs and DApps.
Agile development, team collaboration, solution solving, and dedicated contribution are all my strengths and I am always working to improve these qualities and expertise.
