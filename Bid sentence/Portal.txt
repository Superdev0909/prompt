Hi client.
I have read your proposal carefully and am very interested in your project.
As a professional full-stack developer, I am very familiar with web portal development like Customer portals, partner portals, E-commerce portals, company portals and so on.
Also, during the last development, I have experience leading a frontend team so I can integrate user-friendly, pixel-perfect and responsive web pages.
Credit comes first from me! This is my motto!!!
If you are interested in me, please contact me and let's discuss your project.
Thanks~

PS. My favorite color is grey.


Describe your recent experience with similar projects
I developed E-commerce portal one year ago and lead a frontend team.
During 15 days, we have integrated our portal successfully and gave a great feedback.
