Hi client.
I have read your proposal carefully.
As a dedicated frontend developer who has 6+ years of experience, I am very familiar with many trends in web technologies such as Zendesk.
Using Zendesk, I have developed several websites for daily customer support management, strategic focus and considering a longer time perspective and demonstrating performance of the entire support team using KPI templates.
Here are some of my experienced websites using Zendesk:
https://brickseek.com/
https://copart.com/
https://classicfirearms.com/
Please check this and let's discuss more detail.
Thanks.
