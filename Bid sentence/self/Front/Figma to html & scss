Hi there,

I'm excited to express my interest in your Figma to SCSS and HTML templates project. With 4-5 years of experience in Figma, HTML, TailWind, Bootstrap and LESS/Sass/SCSS, I'm well-prepared to add significant value to your initiative.

Hi there, I would love to assist you in transforming your Figma design into fully functional HTML templates, as you requested. I have built and revamped plenty of Web/Mobile applications in the past using React / React Native, TypeScript, Postgres/MySQL. I feel that these are basic elements that we use and have got extensive experience in using more complex tools and libraries.

Here is an example of my recent work:
It is a ride-sharing app that we built for a Sydney-based client. The app allows users a convenient shopping experience. We built the web application using React Native, Javascript, NodeJS, and MongoDB, and the application is hosted with AWS Amplify. The website of the said business was developed using ReactJS. I am attaching links to the website, app/play store below:
