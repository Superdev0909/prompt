I have worked as a IT engineer for my last company from October 2021.
I just stated to work as a freelancer so that I have no review but I have good experiences about IT in my company.
I have just started this freelancer work.
So I have not yet many reviews.
But I will try for the best.

I read your proposal and see what you mean.
I can start work right now.

Looking for your good reply.
Best regards.
