üëãHello!üëã.
I am interested in your project.
As you may have noticed in my profile, I‚Äôve already got some experience working on such projects.
If you offer me the project, you will notice that the project is in good hands with a trustworthy professional of high ability.
Honestly I am a new freelancer but I am a professional in this field and I‚Äôve worked for 4+ years.
So I think this project is perfectly matched with me.
In particular, I want to make your project successful as my first job.
When you make a choice of me, I am sure you will get to know another talented and experienced developer.
And it would be my honor for me to offer my hand-my effort and technology through writing your project.
I ensure that my production will be of high-quality, and I will always try hard to satisfy customers. (I will do my best.)
Even if you are not willing to have me, I want you to find another talented and experienced guy who can offer you a better finishing touch to make it perfect.
Thanks for your attention.
