Hi,

I understand that the business chatbot needs to be deployed on the web without requiring language localization, with responses at a basic level of complexity that can be achieved through NLP tools like NLTK, Spacy, and Gensim. The bot should be user-friendly, intuitive, reliable and incorporate your feedback throughout the development process. Furthermore, additional features may include Integration with third-party applications, Voice-enabled functionality, Multi-lingual support & Predictive analytics.

My expertise pertaining to chatbot development includes working with Python, Javascript and Node.js as well as bot development platforms like Dialogflow, IBM Watson, and Amazon Lex. Additionally, I have experience in integrating chatbots with other systems, such as CRMs and APIs.

Recently, I was involved in developing a healthcare chatbot with Node.js and Dialogflow, integrated with Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system to provide personalized recommendations based on patient's medical history. Another project was a financial services chatbot built with Python and integrated with CRM system to provide real-time updates on customer account activity.

Looking forward to a call to discuss further.

Thanks

==================================================

You will get an AI chatbot capable of automating anything. Whether for customer support, sales, or internal automation I will build an advanced AI chatbot that can handle any task needed. Knowledge base, FAQs, Natural Language Processing, GPT. Using Node.js and GPT together with either GCloud or Azure the chatbot can automate sales, support, and contact APIs or access the internet. Retrieve, store and save to your database.

When this chatbot is complete I guarantee it will work as intended with no further help, maintenance or management required. It means you don't need to hire me or anyone else to be a full-time or part-time "administrator" of the chatbot. These systems are self-sufficient and can work indefinitely autonomously.


==================================

You will get an AI-based Chatbot that can be used for the following purposes:
 • Faster Replies
 • 24/7 Support
 • Better User Experience
 • More Customers interaction
 • Many integrations with messaging apps
 • Conversation templates
 • Great ROI for businesses
The chatbot will be able to carry entire conversations and help you business grow in day-to-day operations.

====================================

A Chatgpt and neural database-based solution that can index your entire databases like HTML, text, PDF and other documents for semantic searches and uses chatGPT to transform the same into Large Language Models (LLM) for question answering on your documents.

The entire solution is based on various technologies:
- Microsoft Office Power Platform for Admin Panel wherein you can manage the entire knowledge base. It can also be shared with external or internal users as web app.
- Chatbot: This is based on the PVA solution of Microsoft Office Power Platform. It can be integrated into multiple places like websites, teams, whatsapp, slack, etc.
- Backend Semantic DB and Document Parsers: This is developed by me and will be hosted on the Google Cloud server wherein the database and backend solution of interacting with Chatgpt will be hosted. This will cost $350/month.
- Open AI (ChatGPT): The Client needs to provide an open AI key to be integrated into the solution.

This is a complete enterprise solution that can scale tremendously and can be used for various use cases.
