• Sensorless Drive Diagnosis using Logistic Regression.
• Disease extent Prediction of ECG data using Random Forest & SVM.
• Attendance Management System using Image Recognition.
• Lower Back Pain Symptoms Classification using SVM, KNN, DT & NB.
• Face liveness detection using SVM & HOG.
• MNIST based Handwritten Digit Recognition using KNN, NB, PCA, LFD & SOM.
• Handwritten Digit Recognition using Fourier response & SVM.
• IOT Attacks Prediction using SVM, Decision Tree & Random Forest.
• Time Series Price Forecasting using Random Forest.
• Classification of dementia disease using XGboost & Logistics Regression.
• Classification of Iris & Breast cancer using SVM, Decision Tree, neural network & Naive Bayes.
• Classification of Muffin & Cupcake ingredient data using SVM.
• Classification of Nursery data using SVM & Logistic regression.
• Classification of Milk, Sugar, Butter, Egg, Baking Powder, Vanilla, Salt using KNN.
• Prediction of Solar Radiance using SVM & Bayesian Ridge.
• Regression of Boston & Diabetes using Decision Tree, KNN & neural network.
