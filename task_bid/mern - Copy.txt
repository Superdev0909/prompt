As a seasoned web and AI maestro, I've juggled Node.js, JavaScript, and TypeScript like a circus performer with flaming pins. My passion for tech is as infectious as a viral cat meme. I've automated WhatsApp conversations so smoothly, users thought they were chatting with their BFFs.

I'm curious, have you considered the scalability of your WhatsApp automation? It's crucial for handling the viral spread of your user base. I once orchestrated a symphony of code for a startup, where the challenge was to integrate AI-driven customer support on WhatsApp. My method? A blend of Baileys and custom machine learning models. The result? A chatbot so charming, it practically sent users love letters.

I'm all ears for the nitty-gritty of your dynamic team's needs. If there's a particular challenge that's as tough as explaining quantum physics to a toddler, let's unravel it together on a call. When can we have a chat to brew some innovative tech solutions? I'm eagerly waiting for your reply to set the stage on fire with our collaboration!


🟢🟢🟢Hello Davis.
 I'm Yamazaki, your friendly neighborhood developer, here to turn your company's dream into a comedic reality! 🤓
As a seasoned web and AI maestro, I've juggled Wordpress, Shopify and ChatGPT like a circus performer with flaming pins.
Picture this: Prosperous your company and one hilarious developer (that's me!) juggling the numbers like a circus clown. 🤹‍♂️ I've danced with Wordpress  more times than I've hit the snooze button on a Monday morning! My secret? I speak fluent PHP-ese. 🗣️💻

🟢🟢🟢Hello, 
Got a moment to chat about your project?  𝐖𝐞 𝐝𝐢𝐝 𝐚 𝐬𝐢𝐦𝐢𝐥𝐚𝐫 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭 𝐛𝐞𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐞. 

 Your quest for a React developer skilled in seamless API integration and dashboard creation perfectly aligns with my expertise. With 8 years' experience in MERN stack and a robust understanding of Amazon API Gateway and Quicksight, I'm excited about the prospect of crafting interactive dashboards and integrating them effortlessly.

I've honed my skills in React.js and TypeScript, ensuring a smooth navigation of form inputs for bill information and site management. Your future roadmap of incorporating SSO authentication like Okta and additional administration tools excites me—I'm eager to contribute my expertise to enhance this project further.

My collaborative approach and dedication to meeting deadlines make me a reliable choice for this medium-sized project. 

As for the experience, here are some of our relevant projects:
1. We implemented scraping from http://taxsearch.polkcountyiowa.gov/Search, https://salesweb.civilview.com/Sales/SalesSearch, http://landrecords.polkcountyiowa.gov/LandRecords/protected/SrchQuickName.aspx
Scraped phone numbers from https://www.whitepages.com based on scraped data (address and zip code) from the Polk County Assessor http://web.assess.co.polk.ia.us/.

2. We delivered a system that collects vacancies description from 3 different websites (Glassdoor, ESL Cafe, Indeed), using provided query templates and keywords for a search. The system is scalable, so more websites to scrape can be easily added with system updates. Challenges were overcoming scraping protection and customizing parser to search based on free-form text. The parser extracts specific fields, including requirements to the candidate, description of the job, and salary.
Scraped data were sent on client`s API to Wordpress website. Integration with existing systems of a client, such as Microsoft Flow, Visual Studio SSIS, MS Azure SQL database and PowerBI, was performed in order to optimize and improve efficiency.

To provide you with a solid implementation plan, I'd love to dive a bit deeper.
Could you share a few more details so we can make sure it's tailored just right:
1. Do you have any preferences in the programming language or would rely on my experience?
2. I wonder whether you have any deadline for your project? It is important to know to select the most efficient approach for implementing your project in time.
3. What data do you need to extract from the API?
4. In what format is the data provided via AP?

Don't worry, we understand that you might not have all the details and answers yet.

If you are interested in a professional solution and you would like to receive a consultation and an evaluation of your project from us, we guarantee you an answer from our side within 10 minutes, immediately after yours.

Thank you for your time for reading this letter.
Let’s meet in chat to discuss the details and address any questions you may have.
Ready when you are!

❤️❤️❤️

🟢🟢🟢 Greeting!

I am thrilled about the job opportunity you have posted. With over 7 years of experience in AI and Data Science, I have worked extensively on machine learning algorithms, NLP, Computer Vision, and Audio Processing. My skills and expertise make me well-suited to contribute significantly to your projects.

Throughout my career, I have designed numerous AI solutions and successfully integrated various machine learning models into these solutions. I have a proven track record of optimizing performance and ensuring scalability of models. In my previous projects, I have implemented machine learning models for forecasting and recommendation systems, which have resulted in increased revenue for both my companies and clients.

With a deep understanding of OpenAI models like ChatGPT, open source LLMs such as Llama2, Claude2, Falcon, and Mistral, and Vectorbases like Pinecone and ChromaDB, I have successfully developed online and offline chatbots. I also have experience in troubleshooting common fine-tuning errors and ensuring smooth runtime with accurate outputs.

In the field of computer vision, I have rich experience in image segmentation, real-time face swapping, and lip synchronization, which have greatly benefited marketing and advertising efforts. Additionally, I have focused on audio processing, specifically in TTS (text-to-speech) models. I have researched and improved the generation speed and voice quality, achieving similar performance to Air.ai products.

Furthermore, I possess extensive web development experience and am proficient in the MERN stack and fastapi. I am capable of independently implementing any web application, including both frontend and backend development.

I am available to discuss my qualifications further through chat or call, and I am ready to start working immediately, dedicating my full-time availability to your business.

I am genuinely excited about this opportunity and eagerly await our meeting.

Thank you.


=================================================API=============================================

Hi there! 😄👋

Oh, the world of APIs and spreadsheets, where the cells are a canvas, and the data, a paintbrush! 🎨 I'm Yamazaki, your friendly neighborhood developer, here to turn your data extraction dreams into a comedic reality! 🤓

Picture this: Two companies, two sets of data, and one hilarious developer (that's me!) juggling the numbers like a circus clown. 🤹‍♂️ I've danced with APIs more times than I've hit the snooze button on a Monday morning! My secret? I speak fluent API-ese. 🗣️💻

I've got a tale for you: Once upon a code, I connected an API that was more temperamental than a cat on a hot tin roof. But fear not! With a sprinkle of patience and a dash of humor, I tamed that digital beast, and we've been best friends ever since. 😹👯‍♂️

By choosing me, you're not just getting a developer; you're getting a data wizard who'll make your Excel cells do the cha-cha. 💃✨ My custom solutions are like a perfectly tailored suit – they just fit. And your PowerBi dashboard? It'll be so up-to-date, it'll tell you what you had for breakfast before you've even decided. 🍳🔮

Let's get those APIs spilling their secrets into your spreadsheets with the elegance of a swan doing ballet. 🦢🩰 When can we chat about making your data dance to the rhythm of success? 🎶

Looking forward to your reply!



Hi,
I've caught your data extraction vision,
With API access, I'll make a precision.
To feed the spreadsheets, I'll create a command,
Updating monthly, like a symphony planned.

Now, let me ask, have you tried this before?
Implementing ___, we can soar.
My deep tech expertise will surely impress,
Creating a PowerBi dashboard, no less.

I'll address your requests with utmost care,
Handling two companies, separate and fair.
So, when can we chat about this exciting task?
Let's connect and make our ideas clash!

Best wishes,
Harry Huang 😊🎉
