Hi there,

I'd like to contact you because your company vision seems so great and mind-blowing. I'd love to contribute to your project development.
I have 8 years of experience in software development (4 years of blockchain experience), and I have worked as a core dev in past two projects.
My strong skills are Solidity, Typescript, Node.js, and React, and recently I have been working as a blockchain engineer to build DeFi protocols, NFT marketplace, and other kinds of DApps.
I have good experience in writing smart contracts for EVM chains like ETH Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, and Arbitrum.
My another experience is web3 integration stuff using web3.js or ethers.js.
