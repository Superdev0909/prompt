Hi client.
I have read your proposal carefully and completely understood it.
As a professional Python developer, I have experienced many Spotify projects last few years.
With my experience, I am so familiar with Spotify libraries, 3rd party registration and AWS deployment.
Here are some of my experienced projects:
