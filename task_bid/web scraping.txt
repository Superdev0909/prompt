Dear Client,

As a seasoned Full Stack Developer with over 9 years of experience, I specialize in web scraping and data manipulation. I understand you need a script to scrape prices from a wholesale platform using EANs, compare these prices on a marketplace, and provide an output in Excel or TXT format. I can certainly help with this. However, I'd like to clarify that I work on a fixed-price basis for projects. We can discuss the details and pricing further in our chat. Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best Regards

Hi there! 😄👋

Oh, the world of APIs and spreadsheets, where the cells are a canvas, and the data, a paintbrush! 🎨 I'm Chris, your friendly neighborhood developer, here to turn your data extraction dreams into a comedic reality! 🤓

Picture this: Two companies, two sets of data, and one hilarious developer (that's me!) juggling the numbers like a circus clown. 🤹‍♂️ I've danced with APIs more times than I've hit the snooze button on a Monday morning! My secret? I speak fluent API-ese. 🗣️💻

I've got a tale for you: Once upon a code, I connected an API that was more temperamental than a cat on a hot tin roof. But fear not! With a sprinkle of patience and a dash of humor, I tamed that digital beast, and we've been best friends ever since. 😹👯‍♂️

By choosing me, you're not just getting a developer; you're getting a data wizard who'll make your Excel cells do the cha-cha. 💃✨ My custom solutions are like a perfectly tailored suit – they just fit. And your PowerBi dashboard? It'll be so up-to-date, it'll tell you what you had for breakfast before you've even decided. 🍳🔮

Let's get those APIs spilling their secrets into your spreadsheets with the elegance of a swan doing ballet. 🦢🩰 When can we chat about making your data dance to the rhythm of success? 🎶

Looking forward to your reply!

Greeting!

I am thrilled about the job opportunity you have posted. With over 7 years of experience in AI and Data Science, I have worked extensively on machine learning algorithms, NLP, Computer Vision, and Audio Processing. My skills and expertise make me well-suited to contribute significantly to your projects.

Throughout my career, I have designed numerous AI solutions and successfully integrated various machine learning models into these solutions. I have a proven track record of optimizing performance and ensuring scalability of models. In my previous projects, I have implemented machine learning models for forecasting and recommendation systems, which have resulted in increased revenue for both my companies and clients.

With a deep understanding of OpenAI models like ChatGPT, open source LLMs such as Llama2, Claude2, Falcon, and Mistral, and Vectorbases like Pinecone and ChromaDB, I have successfully developed online and offline chatbots. I also have experience in troubleshooting common fine-tuning errors and ensuring smooth runtime with accurate outputs.

In the field of computer vision, I have rich experience in image segmentation, real-time face swapping, and lip synchronization, which have greatly benefited marketing and advertising efforts. Additionally, I have focused on audio processing, specifically in TTS (text-to-speech) models. I have researched and improved the generation speed and voice quality, achieving similar performance to Air.ai products.

Furthermore, I possess extensive web development experience and am proficient in the MERN stack and fastapi. I am capable of independently implementing any web application, including both frontend and backend development.

Hi,
I've caught your data extraction vision,
With API access, I'll make a precision.
To feed the spreadsheets, I'll create a command,
Updating monthly, like a symphony planned.

Now, let me ask, have you tried this before?
Implementing ___, we can soar.
My deep tech expertise will surely impress,
Creating a PowerBi dashboard, no less.

I'll address your requests with utmost care,
Handling two companies, separate and fair.
So, when can we chat about this exciting task?
Let's connect and make our ideas clash!

Best wishes,
Harry Huang 😊🎉
